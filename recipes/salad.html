    <p id="para">
        There isn't a one-size-fits-all rule when it comes to broccoli salad. In fact, every home chef may make their
        broccoli salad a little differently. There are a few ingredients everyone can agree on in a broccoli salad,
        though: broccoli and a creamy, mayo- and
        vinegar-based dressing. Any additional ingredients are up to the cook. Typically, broccoli salads also contain
        things like bacon, red onions, nuts (like almonds), seeds (like
        sunflower seeds), dried fruit (like raisins or dried cranberries), and cheese (usually Cheddar). You can pick
        and choose which ingredients you want to add. For example, this version has bacon, red onions, raisins, and
        almonds. The creamy dressing for the salad is almost always made with mayonnaise, white sugar, and white wine
        vinegar.
